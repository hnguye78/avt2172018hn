			<p>The bulbs cost $57. In the hours before the versatile K-pop maximalists in BTS took the stage at Citi Field on Saturday night, fans were lining up by the thousands at stands throughout the Queens stadium, laying out not-insignificant amounts of cash for branded light sticks the shape of microphones and the size of Big Gulps.</p>

It was the final show of the group’s Love Yourself tour, and the group’s first stadium performance, in this country.
