I recognized in the experience, however, a similar relief to the one I had experienced when I first <a href="../step5/index.html">admitted</a> I was an alcoholic. I began to appreciate the spiritual significance of the program and that this Step was just an introduction to what was yet to come in the remaining seven Steps.
