		<h1> IDENTIFYING FEAR . . . .</h1>
		<h3> ( Step 7) </h3>

</head>
<body>
 
	<h2> When I feel uncomfortable, irritated, or depressed, I look for <a href="../step6/index.html"> fear </a>. This "evil and corroding thread" is the
root of my distress: Fear of failure; fear of other's
opinions; fear of harm, and many other fears. I have
found a Higher Power who does not want me to live in
fear and, as a result, the experience of A.A. in my
life is freedom and joy. I am no longer willing to live
with the multitude of character defects that
characterized my life while I was drinking. <a href="../index.html" class="class2"> Step Seven </a>
is my vehicle to freedom from these defects. I pray for
help in identifying the fear underneath the defect, and
then I ask God to relieve me of that fear. This method
works for me without fail and is one of the great
miracles of my life in Alcoholics Anonymous.</h2>
