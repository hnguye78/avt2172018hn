		<h1> AT THE TURNING POINT</h1>
		

</head>
<body>
 
	<h2> 
At other times turning points are endings, such as when I see clearly the need to stop festering resentments or crippling self-seeking. Many <a href="../index.html" class="class2">shortcomings</a> tempt me daily; therefore, I also have daily opportunities to become aware of them. In one form or another, many of my <a href="../step6/index.html">character defects</a> appear daily: self-condemnation, anger, running away, being prideful, wanting to get even, or acting out of grandiosity.

Attempting half measures to eliminate these defects merely paralyzes my efforts to change. It is only when I ask God for help, with complete abandon, that I become willing—and able—to change.
