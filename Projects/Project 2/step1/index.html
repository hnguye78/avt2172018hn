	<h2>  At the peak of my despair, my infant son became
critically ill with a rare disease. Doctors' efforts
to help him proved useless. I redoubled my efforts to
block my feelings, but now the alcohol had stopped
working. I was left  <a href="../step2/index.html">staring into God's eyes, begging </a>
for help. My introduction to A.A. came within days,
through an odd series of coincidences, and I have
remained sober ever since. My son lived and his
disease is in remission. The entire episode convinced
me of my  <a href="../index.html" class="class2">powerlessness </a> and the unmanageability of my
life. Today my son and I thank God for his
intervention.</h2>
