	<h2> I invest my time in what I truly love. Step Eleven is a discipline that allows me and my Higher Power to be together, reminding me that, with God’s help, intuition and inspiration are possible. Practice of the Step brings on self-love. In a consistent attempt to improve my conscious contact with a Higher Power, I am subtly reminded of my <a href="../step7/index.html"> unhealthy past </a>, with its patterns of grandiose thinking and false feeling of omnipotence. When I ask for the power to carry out <a href="../index.html" class="class2">God’s will</a> for me, I am made aware of my powerlessness. Humility and a healthy self-love are compatible, a direct result of working Step Eleven.</h2>
