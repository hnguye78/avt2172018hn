		<h1> WE BECOME WILLING. . . . . </h1>

	 <h2>How easily I can become misdirected in approaching the Eighth Step! I
wish to be free, somehow transformed by my <a href="../step6/index.html"> Sixth </a> and <a href="../step7/index.html"> Seventh Step </a>
work. Now, more than ever, I am vulnerable to my own self-interest
and hidden agenda. I am careful to remember that self-satisfaction,
which sometimes comes through the spoken forgiveness of those
I have  <a href="../index.html" class="class2">harmed</a>, is not my true objective. I become willing to make
amends, knowing that through this process I am mended and made
fit to move forward, to know and desire God's will for me.
