	<h2> It is through service that the greatest rewards are to be found. But to be in a position of offering true, useful and effective service to others, I must first work on myself. This means that I have to abandon myself to God, <a href="../index.html" class="class2">admitting</a>my faults and clearing away the wreckage of my past. Work on myself has taught me how to find the necessary <a href="../step11/index.html">peace and serenity</a> to successfully merge inspiration and experience. I have learned how to be, in the truest sense, an open channel of sobriety.
