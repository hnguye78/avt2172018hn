	<h2> <a href="../index.html" class="class2"> Honesty </a>, like all virtues, is to be shared. It began after I shared ". . .
[my] whole life's story with someone . . . " in order to find my place in
the Fellowship. Later I shared my life in order to help the newcomer
find his place with us. This sharing helps me to learn honesty in all my
dealings and to know that <a href="../step11/index.html">God's plan </a> for me comes true through honest
openness and willingness.</h2>
