	 <h2>My belief in a Higher Power is an essential part of my work on
<a href="../index.html" class="class2"> Step Nine </a>; forgiveness, timing, and right motives are the other
ingredients. My willingness to do the Step is a growing
experience that opens the door for new and honest relationships
with the <a href="../step8/index.html"> people I have harmed </a>. My responsible action brings me
closer to the spiritual principles of the program -- love and
service. Peace of mind, serenity, and a stronger faith are
sure to follow.
