		<h1> A LOOK BACKWARD </h1>
		

</head>
<body>
	 <h2>It was painful to pause and look backward. I was afraid I might stumble! Couldn't I put the past out of my mind and just live in my new golden present? I realized that those in the past whom I had <a href="../step8/index.html">harmed</a> stood between me and my desire to continue my movement toward serenity. I had to ask for courage to face those persons from my life who still lived in my conscience, to recognize and deal with the guilt that their presence produced in me. I had to look at the damage I had done, and become willing to make <a href="../index.html" class="class2"> amends</a>. Only then could my journey of the spirit resume.
