		<h1> THE LOVE IN THEIR EYES</h1>

	<h2>  It was the changes I saw in the <a href="../step12/index.html">new people </a> who came
into the Fellowship that helped me lose my fear, and
change my negative attitude to a positive one. I could
see the love in their eyes and I was impressed by how
much their "One Day at a Time" sobriety meant to them.
They had looked squarely at Step Two and came to believe
that a <a href="../index.html" class="class2">power</a> greater than themselves was restoring them
to sanity. That gave me faith in the Fellowship, and
hope that it could work for me too.</h2>
