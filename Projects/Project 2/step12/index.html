		<h1> WILLINGNESS TO GROW </h1>

	<h2> Sobriety fills the painful "hole in the soul" that my alcoholism created. Often I feel so physically well that I believe my work is done. However, joy is not just the absence of pain; it is the gift of continued <a href="../index.html" class="class2">spiritual awakening</a>. Joy comes from ongoing and active study, as well as application of the principles of recovery in my <a href="../step10/index.html">everyday life</a>, and from sharing that experience with others. My Higher Power presents many opportunities for deeper spiritual awakening. I need only to bring into my recovery the willingness to grow. Today I am ready to grow.
