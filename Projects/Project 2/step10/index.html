	<h2> During my early years in A.A. I saw <a href="../index.html" class="class2"> Step Ten </a> as a suggestion that I periodically look at
my behavior and reactions. If there was something wrong, I should admit it; if an <a href="../step9/index.html"> apology </a>
was necessary, I should give one. After a few years of sobriety I felt I should undertake
a self-examination more frequently. Not until several more years of sobriety had elapsed
did I realize the full meaning of Step Ten, and the word "continued." "Continued" does
not mean occasionally, or frequently. It means throughout each day.</h2>
