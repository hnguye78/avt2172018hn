	<h2> 
When I did my <a href="../index.html" class="class2">personal inventory </a> I found that I had <a href="../step9/index.html">unhealthy relationships</a> with most people in my lifeâ€”my friends and family, for example. I always felt isolated and lonely. I drank to dull emotional pain. It was through staying sober, having a good sponsor and working the Twelve Steps that I was able to build up my low self-esteem. First the Twelve Steps taught me to become my own best friend, and then, when I was able to love myself, I could reach out and love others.</h2>
