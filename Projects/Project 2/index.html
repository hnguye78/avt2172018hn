</head>
<body>
	

<h2> 1. We admitted we were <a href="step1/index.html">
powerless </a> over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable. </h2>

<h2> 2. Came to believe that a <a href="step2/index.html"> Power </a> greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. </h2>

<h2> 3. Made a decision to turn our  will and our lives over to the <a href="step3/index.html"> care of God </a> as we understood Him.</h2>

<h2> 4. Made a  <a href="step4/index.html"> searching and fearless moral inventory </a> of ourselves. Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. </h2>

<h2> 5. <a href="step5/index.html">Admitted</a> to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.


<h2> 6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of <a href="step6/index.html">character</a>. </h2>

<h2> 7. Humbly asked Him to remove our <a href="step7/index.html"> shortcomings </a>. </h2>

<h2> 8. Made a list of all persons we had <a href="step8/index.html">harmed</a>, and
became willing to make amends to them all.

<h2> 9. Made direct <a href="step9/index.html"> amends </a>to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.

<h2> 10. Continued to take <a href="step10/index.html"> personal inventory</a> and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.

<h2> 11. Sought through <a href="step11/index.html">prayer and meditation </a> to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.

<h2> 12. Having had a <a href="step12/index.html">spiritual awakening</a> as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs.</h2>
