		Hello! My name is King Nguyen and I am a 3rd degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do. I started Tae Kwon Do when I was 9 years old and have been attending classes until 2013. While attending classes at my school, U.S. Tae Kwon Do College in Chantilly, VA, I have gain and develop my skills in forms, sparring, self-defenses, and speaking in Korean. I was in the top of my classes and have competed in numerous tournaments where I have won a number of trophies and medals. My Tae Kwon Do school, would hold it’s own tournaments where I and a couple of my classmates would perform and demonstrate our skills to the audience and lower level belts. Currently I have stopped attending Tae Kwon Do, because I am focusing on school and where I am about to graduate. Perhaps after I graduate, I will think about going back to Tae Kwon Do and start practicing some more so I can compete again. </div>
