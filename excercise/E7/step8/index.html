	<h2> As I face the <a href="../index.html"> Eighth Step </a>, 		everything that was required
		for successful completion of the previous seven Steps came
		together: courage, honesty, sincerity, willingness and
		thoroughness. I could not muster the strength required for
		this task at the beginning, which is why this Step reads
		"Became willing. . . . "
		I needed to develop the courage to begin, the honesty to
		see where I was wrong, a sincere desire to set things
		right, thoroughness in making a list, and willingness to
		take the risk required for true humility. With the help
		of my Higher Power in developing these virtues, I
		completed this Step and continued to move forward in my
		quest for spiritual growth. </h2>
