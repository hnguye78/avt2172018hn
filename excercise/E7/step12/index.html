		<h1> IN ALL MY AFFAIRS</h1>
		<h3> ( Step 12) </h3>

</head>
<body>
 
	<h2> The hard part is practicing these
principles in all my affairs. It is important that I
<a href="../index.html" class="class2"> share the benefits </a> I receive from A.A., especially at
home. Doesn't my family deserve the same patience,
tolerance and understanding I so readily give to the
alcoholic? When <a href="../step10/index.html">reviewing my day </a> I try to ask, "Did I
have a chance to be a friend today and miss it?" " Did
I have a chance to rise above a nasty situation and
avoid it?" "Did I have a chance to say 'I'm sorry,'
and refuse to?" Just as I ask God for help with my
alcoholism each day, I ask for help in extending my
recovery to include all situations and all people!</h2>
