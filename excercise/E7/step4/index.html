	<h2>  <a href="../index.html" class="class2">Step Four </a> is the vigorous and painstaking effort to discover what the
liabilities in each of us have been, and are. I want to find exactly how,
when, and where my natural desires have warped me. I wish to look
squarely at the unhappiness this has caused others and myself. By
discovering what my emotional deformities are, I can move toward
their correction. Without a <a href="../step3/index.html">willing </a> and persistent effort to do this,
there can be little sobriety or contentment for me.</h2>
