	<h1>The Old Testament of the King James Version of the Bible</h1>

	<h2>The First Book of Moses:  Called Genesis</h2> 



 

	

 
	
   <h3><sup>1</sup> In the beginning</h3> <h4> God created the heaven and the earth.

	<sup>2</sup> And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon
	the<p> face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
	waters.

	<sup>3</sup> And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.<p>

	<sup>4</sup> And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light
	from the darkness.

	<sup>5</sup> And God called the light Day, and the darkness he <p>called Night.
	And the evening and the morning were the first day.

	<sup>6</sup> And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,
	and let it<p> divide the waters from the waters.

	<sup>7</sup> And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
	under the firmament from the waters which <p>were above the firmament:
	and it was so.

	<sup>8</sup> And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
	morning were the second day.</h4>
