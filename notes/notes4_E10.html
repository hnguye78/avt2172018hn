		Outside of the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, I blink six or seven times to regain my vision. 

			Have you ever stared directly at a lightbulb for too long? Try staring at 19,000 of them for two and a half hours. Looking around, many are in some state of crying—puffy eyes abound, tears still streaming in several cases. There’s a ringing in my ears; I feel a bit woozy, as blood finally departs from my brain and returns to where it should be. It’s like a flash-bang grenade went off, over and over and over again. But this isn’t a war zone. This is just what it looks like leaving a BTS concert.

		A BTS concert doesn’t start when the seven members of the group take the stage—it starts two and a half hours before that, when the doors of the arena open. Walking to my seat (while others were running to theirs) just minutes after the Prudential Center officially opened, I heard a bass drop and the unmistakable sound of teens screaming. Are they still sound-checking, I thought. That makes no sense. The screams acted like a mating call for other fans, who blitzed past food vendors and merch tables with urgency, following the sound into the arena. Upon making it to Section 109, what I saw was unlike anything I’d seen before: Fans had filled the general admission section on the floor, gathering around a vacant stage to watch two screens that were playing BTS videos. Each time one of the band members appeared for the first time, a loud, high-pitched roar would erupt. Every time a video ended and a new one began, more screams. The loudest reception was bestowed upon a commercial BTS shot for the LG G7 ThinQ Boombox Speaker.
